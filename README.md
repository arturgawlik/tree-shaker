### Purpose

Last time I was checking out the code of https://github.com/rollup/rollup and got inspired to build own `acorn` based very simple and naive treeshaking lib, just to learn something about things related to AST etc.

### Functionalities:

- [ ] strip out not used static imports.
- [ ] strip out not used functions.
